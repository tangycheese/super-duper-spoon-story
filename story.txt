There once sat a cat on a hill. 
He loved to sit on the hill and chase after the birds
Unlike other pet cats, this cat has freedom. He can do whatever he wants, he enjoys his life.
The cat was the king's cat, so he was worshipped by the locals
Unfortunately, this isn't possible to discern at first glance, and the king's cat was mistakenly shot by a hunter who thought he was protexting the local geese population.
